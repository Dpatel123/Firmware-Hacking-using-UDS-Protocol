Firmware Hacking using UDS Protocol
Modern cars include more and more features that first emerged from the consumer electronics industry. Technologies like Bluetooth and Internet-connected services found their way into the vehicle industry. The secure implementation of these func- tions presents a great challenge for the manufacturers, products originating from the consumer industry can often not be easily transferred to the safety-sensitive traf- fic environment due to security concerns. Car manufacturers are at a crossroads, as theyâ€™re trying to deliver the features that customers want, while keeping safety and security. However, common automotive interfaces like the diagnostics port are now also used to implement new services into the car. Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) specifies how diagnostic communication should be handled between a di- agnostic tester and an on-vehicle ECU. This thesis wants to emphasize new threats that appear due to the firmware update services provided by the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS). Potential attack vectors as well as proof-of-concept exploits will be shown and the implications of security breaches on the safe state of the vehicle will be investigated.
